# Simple Website

This is a simple website project that I created during the **first semester** of my computer science studies. This website is dedicated in a humorous way to Disco Polo artists, featuring lighthearted content and fun design elements related to the genre. Website consists of basic HTML, CSS to showcase fundamental web development concepts.

## Features
- Basic HTML structure
- Simple CSS styling

## How to View the Website  
If you have all the files - open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
